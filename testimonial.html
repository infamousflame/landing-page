                    <p>"Betty Hernandez, owner of Expose' Salon, has been doing my hair for over 25 years - we laughingly say that was "when my hair was all one color". She genuinely cares for her clients and besides giving a great haircut, she is a great friend. As I've told her many times, she not only makes me look better, but when I leave her shop I always feel better - inside and out! She is honest with her recommendations for what style works best for my hair and I trust her completely. She does give a fabulous haircut, even as it grows out! I've referred many of my friends over the years and they love all the qualities about her that I've enjoyed."</p>
                    <p>"As a business owner, Betty is very selective in whom she hires and it really shows in the warm reception you receive when entering her shop. Her attention to detail has created a relaxing and soothing environment through-out the shop, but especially in the spa area for massages, facials and pedicures. She has a talent for putting together a great group of people and making everyone feel welcome and special. "</p>
                    <p>"I'm very grateful for all that Betty and her business does for me."</p>

                    <p>"I have been a customer of Betty for over 25 years. I have always found it to be a pleasant experience to have my hair cut at the Exposé Hair Salon. Bettys' staff is friendly and someone will usually inquire if I need help when I arrive for my appointment. The Exposé Salon is clean and the atmosphere is warm. I am a satisfied customer and pleased to recommend the Exposé Salon. "</p>

                    <p>"Since the day I met Betty Hernandez (over 25 years ago) and having my hair styled at Exposé, I am assured of a great haircut and style. You know when the results are great when you have compliments on your hair and people really do not notice it has been cut. Betty and her staff provide a friendly environment. The visit is always relaxed and you are never rushed. They make you feel at home at Exposé and part of their family. I continue to recommend Exposé to my friends. "</p>

                  <p>"Betty Hernandez has styled my family's hair since we moved to Visalia more than 10 years ago. My husband and two daughters wouldn't dream of going anywhere else. For me, a great hair stylist is hard to find and must live up to my expectations: a good listener/detective (to find out what I really want and tell me if it is actually do-able), a patient teacher (to show me how to style my hair and make the most of the cut), offer suggestions on what will work best for my needs, and ultimately, and most importantly to be an artist. Betty is all these things and more. She is always professional but personal at the same time, taking pride in her work and making our satisfaction her goal. The salon itself is stylish and trendy, yet inviting and relaxing - never intimidating. The stylists are friendly and approachable, making it a very relaxed and comfortable atmosphere our family enjoys). "</p>

The salon has been designed with the client in mind and whenever I enter the salon I can instantly feel that I will be taken care of and that I can leave the world behind for a while. The hairdressing staff keeps up with the latest trends in hair care and styling and therefore offers clients their excellent skills and expertise. I can always depend on the Exposé staff being extremely professional and helping me look and feel good about myself. "</p>
